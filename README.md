# TrainScheduler


In this application, you'll have a train schedule that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.

Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains. Namely, their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station!
